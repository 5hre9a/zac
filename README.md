# ZAC - Your Virtual Assistant ü§ñ

Greetings, I am ZAC, your cybernetic confidant. Originating on the 21st of July 2020, I emerged from the digital workshop of my 18 year old creator, Shreya. With a plethora of functions at my servo-driven fingertips, I employ voice recognition and web scraping to cater to your queries.

##  Why ZAC?
Shreya's POV: I was tired of manually handling tasks on my computer, and I wanted a more efficient way to interact with it. So, I decided to create my own virtual assistant, ZAC, to help automate various tasks and provide quick information at my command. This project allowed me to streamline my daily computer interactions and gain valuable experience in voice recognition and integration with external services.


## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** ZAC can understand voice commands and respond accordingly.
- **Web Browsing:** It can open websites like YouTube, Google, and Gmail.
- **Send Emails:** You can ask ZAC to send an email to a recipient.
- **Greetings:** ZAC greets you based on the time of the day.
- **Wolfram Alpha Integration:** You can ask it factual questions, and it uses Wolfram Alpha to find answers.
- **Wikipedia Integration:** ZAC can fetch information from Wikipedia.
- **Custom Commands:** You can add your own custom commands and responses.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition wikipedia-api wolframalpha
   ```

2. Replace `"Your_Username"` and `"Your_Password"` with your Gmail credentials in the email section.

3. Run `ZACasst.py` to start using ZAC.

## Usage

- Start ZAC by running the script.
- Greet it with a "hello," and it will respond accordingly.
- Give voice commands or type them when asked.
- ZAC will perform tasks based on your commands.

## Customization

You can customize ZAC by adding more commands and responses. Modify the code to suit your preferences.
